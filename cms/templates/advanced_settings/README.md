#  Settings Simplified

This implementation is only to show in a more friendly way some Studio Configurations.

## Advanced XBlocks

To show the currently developed XBlocks in a more friendly way is through a checkbox list. This list must be assigned in the site configurations (Studio). 

The following format should be used:

```
"ADVANCED_MODULES":{
    "xblock_1":"Friendly XBlock Name",
    "xblock_2":"Friendly XBlock Name 2"
}
```

Where *xblock_n* is the string that is placed in edX's default textarea input.
